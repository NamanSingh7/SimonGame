Simon games challenge memory retention capacity by generating a sequence of 
Colors for a player to repeat. After each successful series of presses, “Simon” repeats 
The list followed by an additional random color. Game play continues until the player
Makes a mistake.

After the player inputs the correct color by pressing the appropriate key on the pad, 
“Simon” repeats the color pattern from the beginning.

Each game instruction and key press is coupled with a distinctive tone. Upon an
Incorrect key press, the speaker plays an ominous melody line, indicating the end of 
The game. After the player loses the game, the total score (the length of the longest 
Sequence of correctly returned colors) is displayed In binary on an LED array.
